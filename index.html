                <p> you'll probably get the linux rant eventually because I just switched my laptop over but at this point its so long. its such a needlessly long and dramatic rant </p>

                <p> we love POSIX we love UNIX. we do NOT love cmd. yucky stinky not posix compliant whole other set of commands. i aint memorizing all that </p>

                <p> Did you know NodeJS comes with its own local server host... if you run <span class="codeblock"> npx http-server (folder to execute in) </span> it starts up a server for you!! adding the -o flag before specifying what folder to execute in also opens it in your default browser of choice </p>

                <p> it's been very very useful for me because I very quickly realized that XAMPP is Annoying on Linux because of how permissions work (especially with how I have things set up) and it just. comes free with your NodeJS. </p>

                <p> anyway that's all I got for this one please give me 100 I wrote this all from scratch so I fully understand what's going on and I like seeing 100 when I look at this course on blackboard </p>
